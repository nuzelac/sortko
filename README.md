# Sortko

The smartphone mobile learning application Sortko provides students with an option of choosing a sort (e.g. bubble sort, shell sort, quick sort, insertion sort, etc.) and generates a random sequence of numbers to be sorted by applying a sequence of specific interaction gestures. During the sorting process, Sorko informs students about their success in performing “switches” (element exchanges) and provides them with messages facilitating further progress, making the experience of learning sorting algorithms more intuitive, discoverable and fun.
